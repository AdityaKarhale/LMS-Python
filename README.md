ðŸ“š Library Management System â€“ Mini Project
A simple desktop-based Library Management System developed using Python with a Tkinter GUI and SQLite database. The system helps manage library operations like issuing and returning books, adding students and books, and tracking history.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python (Core Language)

Tkinter (GUI Library)

SQLite3 (Local Database)

â”œâ”€â”€ main.py       # Contains all backend logic (database operations, business logic)
â”œâ”€â”€ gui.py        # All GUI windows using Tkinter
â”œâ”€â”€ library_db.db # SQLite database file 
â””â”€â”€ README.md     # Project documentation

ðŸ§  How It Works
Database:

Uses SQLite tables: all_books, all_studs, and all_issued.

All DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE) and SELECT queries are managed in main.py.

GUI:

GUI is built using Tkinter (gui.py).

Each operation has its own popup window for clean input/output.

Input validation and user feedback via messagebox.

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
Run the setup.py first
